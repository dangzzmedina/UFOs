# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
* The purpose of this analysis is to learn how to use Javascript to join data from different files and apply them to a website to create neatly ordered display of information. In this module we were able to set a box filter that would search filtered data that a user might input. The module taught us how to call functions inside functions to build a new dataset with filtered information and display it in an html url.
## Results: Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

* Dana could search UFO sites by different filters we created on the left side of the html site. She should be able to input the information on the blank line and navigate through the entire dataset we have to help her research.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

* The drawback is the button system. We did not finish the last part of the project. The website cannot navigate through the filtered data without it. I would also reccomend to  add references to the UFO's sighting for more legitimacy. Finally I would recommend to create a next button to load a new page. this will be a more clean navigation through the dataset.
